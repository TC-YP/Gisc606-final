 I.  My ideal job in GIS is city planning, to advocate for better communal places, or to further work with archeologasits and create maps on ancient civilizations.

 II.   My favorite part of GIS is cartography but the use of coding to help automate data processing, is exciting for me cause it allows continous research products to focus more time analyzing differences.
    
III.    I would like to create several mockup maps to put in a portfolio, while I still have access to resources. Outsode of GIS, I would also like to finish up one of m y paintings that I haven't worked on since last year.
