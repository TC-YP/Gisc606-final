I. Getting the code explained to while doing the lab work. I learn best by following along and producing an actual end goal, rather than straight lecture, so it helped alot in understanding each new command.

II. Three hours of straight coding. I don't have the best setup to be sitting for hours at a time and wanted to get up and stretch but feared falling behind the class if I did.

III. Please include at least one five minute break, it was hard to keep up sometimes with the constant coding.
